# NBA Trades Constructor

Hello and welcome to the NBA trades constructor! This tool is for coming up
with all possible combinations of players for return in a trade according
to the NBA's salary matching rules. It does _not_ say if a trade is fair
or balanced, nor does it handle other trade eligibility details like no-trade
clauses or players who only become eligible on certain dates. At least yet.

To use it, please select a team and hit submit. Then select which players
to send out in the deal, with a maximum of 3, and hit submit. Lastly, select
the number of players you want in return for the outgoing players and hit
submit.

This will show you the outgoing players and their total salary and list
all of the possible player based trade returns, by team.
